## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Prisma Setup

You need decide between prisma local development with `sqlite` or a real database with for example `postgresql` or `sqlserver`. Define it in the `schema.prisma` file.

Consider adding a `.env` file to the root of the project and use the environment variables inside `schema.prisma` with `env("DATABASE_URL")`, refer to `.env.sample`.

When using sqlite, initialize the database with:

```bash
npm run prisma.push
```

Seed prisma/seed.ts for initial data:

```sh
npm run prisma.seed
```

To view your data in the database, you can run:

```bash
npm run prisma.studio
```

When using a real database with for example postgresql or sqlserver, you need to migrate the database schema with:

```bash
npm run prisma.migrate
```

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever css framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.
