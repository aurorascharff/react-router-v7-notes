A notes application built with React Router v7, featuring pending UI, Zod for schema validation, Tailwind CSS v4, and Prisma. Using framework mode with SSR and pre rendering, and loaders and actions on the server.

- 📖 [React Router v7 docs](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Prisma Setup

You need decide between prisma local development with `sqlite` or a real database with for example `postgresql` or `sqlserver`. Define it in the `schema.prisma` file.

Consider adding a `.env` file to the root of the project and use the environment variables inside `schema.prisma` with `env("DATABASE_URL")`, refer to `.env.sample`.

When using sqlite, initialize the database with:

```bash
npm run prisma.push
```

Seed prisma/seed.ts for initial data:

```sh
npm run prisma.seed
```

To view your data in the database, you can run:

```bash
npm run prisma.studio
```

When using a real database with for example postgresql or sqlserver, you need to migrate the database schema with:

```bash
npm run prisma.migrate
```

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`
